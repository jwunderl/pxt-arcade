# About: Where to Start

This course focuses on transitioning from the Block-based environment to a JavaScript environment,
and expanding on the ideas taught in the first two courses.

If you are learning to code for the first time, it is suggested that you start with
[CS Intro 1](/courses/csintro1) and [CS Intro 2](/courses/csintro2),
which go in depth into many core programming concepts.
This course assumes experience with these concepts,
so if you choose to start here you might want to review the concepts in
those courses as they come up.

If you have completed the first two courses in this series,
then you are in the right place.
The [Introduction section](/courses/csintro3/intro) is the first section of this course.

If you have experience with other MakeCode editors or programming in general,
the [Game Design Concepts](/concepts) tutorials describe a number of concepts
and blocks that are unique to game development.

The following tutorials may also be useful in learning about concepts that
you might not have seen elsewhere:

* [Eat the Doughnut](/#tutorial:tutorials/eat-the-doughnut)
* [Simple Maze](/#tutorial:tutorials/simple-maze)
* [Star Field](/#tutorial:tutorials/star-field)
* [Happy Flower](/#tutorial:tutorials/happy-flower)
* [Simple Extensions](/#tutorial:tutorials/simple-extensions)

Additionally, you may find it useful to check out the review material
for the previous courses:

* [CS Intro 2 Review](/courses/csintro2/review)
