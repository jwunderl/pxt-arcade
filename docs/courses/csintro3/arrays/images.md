# Activity: Arrays of Images

``||images:Images||`` are used to represent many things on screen in @boardname@ - ``||scene:backgrounds||``, ``||sprites:Sprites||``, many other elements of the games.

A number of complex behaviors can be handled easily using ``||arrays:arrays||`` of ``||images:Images||``, allowing for games with a larger variety of content for the person playing to experience.

## Concept: Simple Animations

Animations in games are represented as a series of different images that get shown in a sequence.

Using ``||arrays:arrays||``, these ``||images:images||`` can be stored in a single location and referenced much more easily than they could be using individual variables.

## Example #1: Flapping Duck

1. Review the code below
2. Identify how the ``||images:Image||`` array is created
3. Identify how the ``||loops:for||`` loop is used to iterate through the different ``||images:images||`` of the ``||sprites:ducks||``

```typescript
enum SpriteKind {
    Player,
    Enemy
}

let characterImages: Image[] = [
    sprites.duck.duck1,
    sprites.duck.duck2,
    sprites.duck.duck3,
    sprites.duck.duck4,
    sprites.duck.duck5,
    sprites.duck.duck6
];

let duck: Sprite = sprites.create(characterImages[0], SpriteKind.Player);
for (let index = 0; index < characterImages.length; index++) {
    pause(150);
    duck.setImage(characterImages[index]);
}
```

## Student Task #1: Walking Hero

1. Start with the code from example #1
2. Modify the code to show a **hero walking** instead of a **flying duck**, by replacing the images in ``||variables:characterImages||``
3. Use a second ``||loops:for||`` loop that causes the current ``||loops:for||`` loop to repeat **20** times, so that the animation will continue to repeat

### ~hint

The ``||images:images||`` of a hero walking can be referenced using the following variables:

* ``||sprites:sprites.castle.heroWalkFront1||``
* ``||sprites:sprites.castle.heroWalkFront2||``
* ``||sprites:sprites.castle.heroWalkFront3||``
* ``||sprites:sprites.castle.heroWalkFront4||``

## Concept: Remainder Operator

Creating an animation using arrays is useful, but does lead to some issues. For example, what if the intention is to run it in the background, forever?

One approach would be to use the ``||game:on update interval||`` event. Using this with the previous example might look like the snippet below.

```typescript-ignore
let count = 0;
game.onUpdateInterval(150, function () {
    duck.setImage(characterImages[count]);
    count++;
});
```

However, this won't quite work; after the last index in the array, the code will crash, because you will be trying to refer to an ``||images:image||`` that **doesn't exist**.

This could be handled using ``||logic:logic||`` to reset the value when it gets too high.

```typescript-ignore
let count = 0;
game.onUpdateInterval(150, function () {
    duck.setImage(characterImages[count]);
    count++;
    if (count == characterImages.length) {
        count = 0;
    }
});
```

The **remainder** operator, ``%``, can be used to handle this case more appropriately. This operator is used to signify the **remainder** of integer division between two numbers: that is, ``5 % 3`` is equal to 2, because 5 goes into 3 one time, with **two remaining**.

### ~hint

The remainder operator is often referred to as the ``mod`` operator, short for modulo or modulus.

### ~

## Example #2: Continually Flapping Duck

1. Review the code below
2. Identify how ``||variables:count||`` is used
3. Identify how the remainder (``%``) operator is used to refer to a value within the ``||images:image||`` ``||arrays:array||``

```typescript
enum SpriteKind {
    Player,
    Enemy
}

let characterImages: Image[] = [
    sprites.duck.duck1,
    sprites.duck.duck2,
    sprites.duck.duck3,
    sprites.duck.duck4,
    sprites.duck.duck5,
    sprites.duck.duck6
];

let duck: Sprite = sprites.create(characterImages[0], SpriteKind.Player);
let count: number = 0;

game.onUpdateInterval(150, function () {
    duck.setImage(characterImages[count % characterImages.length]);
});
```

## Student Task #2: Continuous Walking Animation

1. Start with the code from task #1
2. Replace the ``||loops:for||`` loops with the ``||game:on update interval||`` event with a ``||variables:counter||`` as shown in example #2 to make the animation run indefinitely
3. Make the hero ``||controller:move||`` with the directional buttons

## Concept: Random Images

In games, ``||sprites:sprites||`` will often need to be created a large number of times, to represent ``||sprites:enemies||``, ``||sprites:collectible items||``, or anything else.

To make the games more visually appealing, these ``||sprites:Sprites||`` can be given different ``||images:images||`` to make sure they do not all look the same.

The ``||sprites:sprites.createEmptySprite||`` event and ``||sprites.onCreated||`` function are helping for handling this type of behavior.

```sig
sprites.createEmptySprite(0);
```

```sig
sprites.onCreated(0, null);
```

## Example #3: Asteroids!

1. Review the code below
2. Identify how the different images for ``||sprites:Asteroid||``s are defined
3. Identify what occurs when an ``||sprites:Asteroid||`` is ``||sprites:created||``
4. Identify how ``||math:Math.pickRandom||`` is used to pick a ``||math:random||`` ``||images:image||``

```typescript
enum SpriteKind {
    Player,
    Enemy,
    Asteroid
}

let asteroids: Image[] = [
    sprites.space.spaceAsteroid0,
    sprites.space.spaceAsteroid1
];

game.onUpdateInterval(1000, function () {
    sprites.createEmptySprite(SpriteKind.Asteroid);
});

sprites.onCreated(SpriteKind.Asteroid, function (sprite: Sprite) {
    sprite.setImage(Math.pickRandom(asteroids));
    sprite.y = Math.randomRange(0, screen.height);
    sprite.x = Math.randomRange(0, screen.width);
});
```

## Student Task #3: Falling Asteroids

1. Start with the code from example #3
2. In the ``||sprites:on created||`` event, set the ``||variables:sprite||`` ``||sprites:y||`` position to be 0, so it starts at the top of the screen
3. After setting the ``||sprites:y||`` position, set the ``||sprites:vy||`` to a ``||math:random value between||`` 30 and 50
4. Set the ``||sprites:Ghost||`` flag for every ``||sprites:Asteroid||`` to ``||logic:true||``

### ~hint

The other ``||sprites:Asteroid||`` ``||images:images||`` can be referenced using the following ``||variables:variables||``:

* ``||sprites:sprites.space.spaceAsteroid2||``
* ``||sprites:sprites.space.spaceAsteroid3||``
* ``||sprites:sprites.space.spaceAsteroid4||``

## What did we learn?

1. How does using multiple ``||images:images||`` allow for games that are more visually appealing?
2. How is the **remainder** operator used to make sure the code never accesses an invalid index in the ``||arrays:array||``?
