# Additions to Case Study

At this point, you have the knowledge necessary to deal with a larger pieces of code - in particular, by using comments to leave information for anyone reading it in the future, as well as namespaces to split code into logical chunks.

To get a head start on future topics, there are a few more namespaces that we will add in to make the game a bit more interesting, and give a framework for future tasks to build upon.

Below are two snippets of code: the first is the current state of the example case study, prior to this section, and the second is the version that will be referenced going forward. Duplicate these changes into your game, and play around for a bit to identify what has been added.

### ~hint

In future activities, the solutions will be limited to show the sections of the code that have been updated - in particular, any namespaces that were changed, as well any top level code that was modified.

This will help focus on the sections of the code that are relevant to each task, without having to search through the entire game's code for every single change.

## Current Game

```typescript
// TODO insert example up to this point (solution from namespaces lesson)
```

## New Version

```typescript
// TODO cherry pick a few sections from intro/case-study final game and bump them up in here.
```
