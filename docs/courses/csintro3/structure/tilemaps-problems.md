# Problem Set: Tile Maps

This section contains a number of selected problems for the Tile Maps section.

It is recommended that you review the problems, and complete a few before moving on to the next section.

## Problem #1: Say Hi!

Using only ``||scene:scene.setTileMap||``, create an **8 x 8** ``||scene:tile map||`` that looks like it is saying "Hi!". Make the "H" **red**, the "i" **blue**, and the "!" **green**.

## Problem #2: Create a Garden

Create an **8 x 8** garden like the example below.

Set at least **three** of the different color ``||scene:tiles||`` to have a custom image - either a flower that you drew yourself, or one of the types of flowers or grass included in the gallery.
