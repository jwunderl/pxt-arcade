From what we learned in the previous lessons we should be able to make some great games. 

## Student Task #1:

1. Generate several quick game ideas (at least 3) and discuss with another student on what is good and what can be improved
2. Pick the game to be built and design a simplest version of that game to start with. We call this a MVP or Minimum Viable Product. It is the simplest version of a a product that has some working features
3. Make the MVP fast - not perfect. Test it and show it to others for feedback. Decide which features you will add to the game
4. **Use a tile map with**
    * at least 2 different tiles on your tile map
    * on *sprite* hits wall event
5. Include at least **5** of the following in creating a game:
    * ``||loops:update||`` every loop
    * Position (set or change coordinates)
    * Controller (dx) and ``||controller:control sprite with||``
    * Overlap Events / sprite kind
    * Random
    * Showing numbers as string
    * Score / life
    * Countdown
    * Flip
    * ghost
    * Set image
    * Sprite say
    * Splash
    * create / on create
    * Math (multiply, divide, add, or subtract)
    * set background color
6. **Challenges:** Use at least one of the following in extending the MVP or creating a new game:
    * A tile map with walls
    * The Corgio extension
    * The Darts extension
7. Repeat this process as time allows, until you've created as many games as required for the project

## What did we learn? 

1. Discuss something that was difficult to implement in the game. Describe what you learned or a how you would improve how the game code works.
2. Discuss your favorite feature of the game and how it was implemented.
