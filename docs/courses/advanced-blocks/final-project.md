# Activity: Final Project

In this activity, students will incorporate functionality learned throughout the course sections to build a well functioning game in building a game of their own design.

It is a good idea to start the game as a MVP (minimum viable project) to demonstrate the concepts and ideas, but the final product will be a complete working game. The full game can be based off of a previous game, or from an entirely new code and design. This will likely take multiple days to fully develop into a polished final product so it is important to track your progress. A good check to see if you have the time required for the project is to build out the basic functionality as soon as possible in the MVP. Then decide if features should be cut or if there is time to add some final features to the game.

### Requirements

* Use at least one concept from each section of the course - for example, from `Motion and Events`, you could use:

>* ``||controller:control sprite with vx vy||``
>* ``||sprites:on overlap events||``
>* sprite physics

* If one of the sections (tile maps, arrays, ...) does not seem to be relevant the game you are creating, then explain why the given section features are omitted in your game (check with instructor)
* Choose **four** sections from the course, and use at least one additional concept from each
* For each of the above concepts, write a short sentence on how it allows your game to be more interesting or challenging for the player

### Challenge: Learning new blocks

A significant part of software development comes down to learning - about new functions and methods available to you, new concepts that allow you to more easily complete your work, and all sorts of other things.

For this challenge, you will dig into one of two groups of functions that we have only lightly examined: ``||music:Music||`` (included by default) and ``||animation:Animation||`` (found as an extension). To complete this challenge, use one of these two sections in your final game in a thoughtful way; this means that you will have to read through the functions **on your own**, and identify both how it works, and what it can be used for.
