# Tips and Tricks

## Finding examples and documentation

There are a number of examples you can try out on the https://arcade.makecode.com homepage.
We also have several courses in development that are located [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/courses).
API reference docs are located [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/reference).

## "JavaScript" == "TypeScript"

Despite the name shown in the MakeCode editor, our text language is actually a stricter subset of
TypeScript. More information on what's supported can be found in the [language docs](https://makecode.com/language).

## Source Control

The MakeCode editor stores all of your projects in browser's local storage. The
easiest way to back up a blocks project is to simply "download" it. For text
projects, MakeCode has GitHub integration. Read more [here](https://makecode.com/extensions/github-authoring).

MakeCode also supports "extensions" (libraries or packages) in projects, so it's possible to split your project
into multiple repositories or libraries. Find more information [here](https://makecode.com/extensions).

## Music and Art

Documentation on how to import and use images in Arcade can be found [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/developer/images).

The arcade editor is located in [pxt-arcade](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-arcade). The game engine and runtime code is in [pxt-common-packages](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-common-packages).

Most of the code related to Arcade can be found in the `libs/game` directory of that repo.
